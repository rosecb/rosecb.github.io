<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
Hi, I'm Rose! Based on my interests, I would say I'm more of the creative side with drawing and designing. So I would love to apply this to more technical and business skills. As I'm almost always on the internet, I'm quite drawn to technology, especially apps and websites. 

<h1 id="why-mis">Why MIS?</h1>
I'm quite interested in developing or creating things. At the time I was submitting the app for UH, I was (and still kind of is) confused on what exactly what I want to do as a career. I was in the business academy at my high school, so I just put exploratory business as the major while applying. I chose MIS later on, as I'm quite interested in technology, but mostly design. Shidler had a major that related to business and technology, so I eventualy chose MIS as my major. 

I'm also trying to double major in marketing, as it is also one of the things I'm interested in. I like the creative side of marketing, so I think both majors can go together. I'm drawn to the design part of coding/programming. I personally like the visual and aesthetic aspect of websites and apps. So I'm actually super interested in UX and UI Design. I look forward to learning more about Javascript this semester, as my uncle mentioned that most front-end designers use this language. 

Thank you! <3
